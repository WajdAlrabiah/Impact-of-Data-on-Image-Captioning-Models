# Impact-of-Data-on-Image-Captioning-Models
A comprehensive exploration of how dataset quantity and quality influence the performance of image captioning models. The project fine-tunes a pre-trained Git-based vision-language model using the One Piece image-caption dataset, and evaluates results using Word Error Rate (WER).
